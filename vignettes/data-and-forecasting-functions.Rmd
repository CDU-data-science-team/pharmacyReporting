# Forecasting and data functions

<!--
Create a chunk for the core of the function

- The chunk needs to be named `function` at least
- It contains the code of a documented function
- The chunk can also be named `function-my_median` to make it easily
findable in your Rmd
- Let the `@examples` part empty, and use the next `examples` chunk instead

After inflating the template

-  This function code will be added in a new file in the "R/" directory
-->


<!--
Create a chunk with a test of use for your function

- The chunk needs to be named `tests` at least
- It contains working tests of your function
- The chunk is better be named `tests-my_median` to be handled
correctly when inflated as a vignette

After inflating the template

-  This test code will be added in the "tests/testthat/" directory
-->
