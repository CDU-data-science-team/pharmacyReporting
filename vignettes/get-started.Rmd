<!-- Run this 'development' chunk -->
<!-- Store every call to library() that you need to explore your functions -->


# The first function of the package: Calculate the median of a vector

<!--
Create a chunk for the core of the function

- The chunk needs to be named `function` at least
- It contains the code of a documented function
- The chunk can also be named `function-my_median` to make it easily
findable in your Rmd
- Let the `@examples` part empty, and use the next `examples` chunk instead

After inflating the template

-  This function code will be added in a new file in the "R/" directory
-->


<!--
Create a chunk with a test of use for your function

- The chunk needs to be named `tests` at least
- It contains working tests of your function
- The chunk is better be named `tests-my_median` to be handled
correctly when inflated as a vignette

After inflating the template

-  This test code will be added in the "tests/testthat/" directory
-->


<!--

# There can be development actions

Create a chunk with 'development' actions

- The chunk needs to be named `development` or `dev`
- It contains functions that are used for package development only
- Note that you may want to store most of these functions in the 0-dev_history.Rmd file

These are only included in the present flat template file, their content will not be part of the package anywhere else.
-->


# Inflate your package

You're one inflate from paper to box.
Build your package from this very Rmd using `fusen::inflate()`

- Verify your `"DESCRIPTION"` file has been updated
- Verify your function is in `"R/"` directory
- Verify your test is in `"tests/testthat/"` directory
- Verify this Rmd appears in `"vignettes/"` directory
